#Welcome to TourVisio API Documentation

TourVisio APIs, formerly known as TourVisio Web Services, provide easier, faster and more flexible access to the SAN system functionality and products. Through the Internet, you can integrate our products and services. APIs are ideal for developers who want to build or update a customized booking application for their website with TourVisio.

-------------------------
###Working with Postman

A sample postman workspace for Tourvisio Web Service can be found [**here**](https://www.postman.com/santsg/workspace/tourvisio-web-service-documentation). 
After forking the provided environment and collections that meet your needs (authentication, products, booking etc.), you can start by sending and examining request and response examples. 

Note that some fields (e.g. credentials) are not provided in the environment and current values need to be filled by the users in order to run collections successfully.

-------------
###Technology

TourVisio Web Services are using REST (Representational state transfer) protocol. Please click for more details about REST protocol. The system is supporting only JSON (application/json) for content type.

----------------------------------
###Support Options for API

Several support options are available during the development of new and modification to existing applications. We support the functionality of Web Services only; the programming technique, language, and environment is not supported.

**When encountered with a problem or error, for rapid investigation and resolution please provide requestId returned in response header and/or raw request/response if possible.**
