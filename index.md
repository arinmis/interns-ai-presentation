## What is AI?

Systems or machines that can simulate human intelligence.

- **Learning** from data (machine learning)
- **Reasoning** to solve problems
- **Understanding** language (natural language processing)
- **Perceiving** the world (computer vision)
- **Acting** autonomously (virtual agents)

---

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** A branch of computer science focused on creating machines that simulate human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming.
- **Neural Networks (NNs):** Computational models inspired by the human brain, used for pattern recognition and classification.
- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to model complex patterns in data.
- **Generative AI (GenAI):** AI systems capable of creating new content, such as text, images, or audio.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Advanced GenAI models specialized in understanding and generating human language.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data to predict outcomes for new, unseen inputs.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach where models find patterns or groupings in data without labeled outcomes.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

# Generative AI

- Generative AI refers to systems that can create new content—such as text, images, or audio—by learning patterns from existing data.
- It predicts which token will be next based on previous tokens.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.

---

## Agents

Agents are AI systems that can autonomously perceive their environment, reason, and take actions to achieve specific goals, often using chain-of-thought reasoning.
