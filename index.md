## What is AI?

Systems or machines that can simulate human intelligence.

- **Learning** from data (machine learning)
- **Reasoning** to solve problems
- **Understanding** language (natural language processing)
- **Perceiving** the world (computer vision)
- **Acting** autonomously (virtual agents)

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** A branch of computer science focused on creating machines that simulate human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming.
- **Neural Networks (NNs):** Computational models inspired by the human brain, used for pattern recognition and classification.
- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to model complex patterns in data.
- **Generative AI (GenAI):** AI systems capable of creating new content, such as text, images, or audio.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Advanced GenAI models specialized in understanding and generating human language.
